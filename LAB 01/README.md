# 💻 CS-1201 Object Oriented Programming – Lab 01

This lab focuses on understanding and implementing **structures in C++**. Through three practical tasks, students will explore structure declaration, arrays of structures, and structure pointers with member functions.

---

# ⭐ Task 1: Student Structure with Member Function
## 🔍 Overview

This program demonstrates how to declare a structure named `Student` with data members such as first name, last name, roll number, and marks. It also includes a member function `displayStudentInfo()` to show student details.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how structures group related data and how member functions can be used to display information.

## ✔️ Output

Displays the full name and marks of a student using the structure’s member function.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

- Declare and define structures in C++
- Add member functions inside structures
- Access and display structure data members

---

# ⭐ Task 2: Array of Student Structures
## 🔍 Overview

This program extends the previous task by using an **array of structures** to store details of multiple students. The user inputs data for each student, and the program calls `displayStudentInfo()` for all.

## 🎯 Objective

To practice storing and managing multiple records using arrays of structures.

## ✔️ Output

Displays the full name and marks of each student entered by the user.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

- Create arrays of structures
- Input and store multiple records
- Traverse arrays to access and display structure data

---

# ⭐ Task 3: Structure Pointers
## 🔍 Overview

This program modifies the previous task to use **pointers to structures**. Student details are dynamically assigned using pointers, and the member function is called through the pointer.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how pointers can be used to access structure members and call member functions.

## ✔️ Output

Displays student details using pointer-based access (`->` operator).

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

- Use pointers with structures
- Dynamically assign values to structure members
- Call member functions using structure pointers
